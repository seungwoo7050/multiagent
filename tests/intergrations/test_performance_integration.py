"""
Performance integration tests for the multi-agent platform.

These tests evaluate the performance characteristics:
- Throughput under concurrent load
- Memory usage patterns
- LLM adapter performance
- Response time distributions
- Redis operation performance

Requirements:
- Running Redis instance
- Valid API keys for LLMs
- Running application server
